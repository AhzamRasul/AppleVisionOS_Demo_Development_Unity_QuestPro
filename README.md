![Screenshot 2023-08-22 164753](https://github.com/AhzamRasul/AppleVisionOS_Demo_Development_Unity_QuestPro/assets/50517265/4f7b47f4-561a-48de-9aa0-e1860f809b7c)


## Overview

This project aims to replicate Apple's VisionOS for the Meta QuestPro VR headset using Unity. VisionOS provides an immersive and intuitive interface for users, and this project will attempt to recreate some of its key features within the Unity environment. You can download the repo, create the build and Test it on you QuestPro headset

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Create a dynamic home screen with customizable widgets and interactive elements.

- **Gesture Control**: Utilize the Meta QuestPro's gesture control capabilities to navigate through the interface.

- **3D Environment**: Design a visually appealing and immersive 3D environment for the interface.

## Requirements

- Unity 2022.3.2f1 LTS (Long-Term Support)

- Meta QuestPro SDK 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/VisionOS-Unity-Replica.git

Please note that replicating an entire operating system interface like VisionOS in Unity is a challenging task and may require substantial knowledge of UI/UX design, 3D graphics, animations, VR interaction design, and more. This README template assumes you have a strong grasp of these concepts and are prepared for a complex development journey.

Also, keep in mind that while you can create a visually similar interface, replicating the full functionality and user experience of VisionOS would likely require significant resources and potential legal considerations, given the proprietary nature of Apple's operating systems.
